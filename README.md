### Template
I have designed my website using the following [template](https://github.com/jonbarron/jonbarron.github.io). If you like this templaye, you can clone the original repo and design it according to your need. 
Also, consider using Leonid Keselman's [Jekyll fork](https://github.com/leonidk/leonidk.github.io) of this page.
